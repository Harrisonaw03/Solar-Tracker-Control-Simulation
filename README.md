This project was completed in several stages:
- Input Signal Construction and Validation
- Photovoltaic cell modelling
- Control of maximum power point of PV Cell
- Control of axial motion

To run the simulation, download "Location_Data.xlsx", run "Initialisation.m" then open "Simulation_Application.mlapp" and "Solar_Position.slx".

Select desired location to simulate in "Simulation_Application.mlapp", then click to run the simulation. This will run "Solar_Position.slx". 

To save the output, simply click the "Save Outputs" button on the Application.

"All_Scenario_Signals.mat" contains six position signals for regular interval locations and their irradiances.

Open and Run "Irradiance__.slx" to observe the controller actions based on the "All_Scenario_Signals.mat" signals.
